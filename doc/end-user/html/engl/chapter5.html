		</td>
		<td>You
have set a minimum distance between two occurances of the same tile in
the mosaic or you have set a value for the maximum number of occurances
for the tile in the mosaic. Try decreasing the minimum distance or
increasing the maximum number of occurances or uncheck the options. You
could also use a database with more entries.</td>

		<td>Error loading the tile image "FILENAME"!</td>
		<td>Propably
the image was deleted or changed into an incompatible format after
adding it to the selected database. If this is the case, loading the
database in the "Edit database" dialog and updating it there will
resolve the problem. <br>It might also be that the file is on a
removable storage device that is not plugged in. If so, plug it in and
restart the process. <br>If this doesn't help, perhaps your computer ran out of memory. Try creating a photographic mosaic with less megapixels then.</td>
