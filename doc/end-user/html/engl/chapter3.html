<h1>3. Image Databases</h1>
<h2><a name="3.1">3.1 Creating an Image Database</a></h2>
<p>Before you can create a photographic mosaic, you have to set up an
image database that contains all the pictures the mosaic will be made
of.</p>

<br>
<p>To do so, click the "Create Database" button in the main window:</p>
<div align="left"><img src="pics/mainwin.png" height="581" width="686"></div>

<br>
<div align="left"><img src="pics/builddb.png" height="176" width="612"></div>
<p>In the above dialog, you have to select a filename for the new database file. 
<br>Also select a directory that contains the pictures the mosaic will
be made of. Note that the more pictures are in the directory, the
better the result will be. Adding more folders or files is possible in
the "Edit database" dialog. For good results, there should be several
thousand pictures with lots of different motifs and base colors in the
database. It is also advantageous that all pictures have the same or a
similar aspect ratio. For the best results, the dye distribution should
be regularly and the contrast and dynamic should be low. But don't
worry, you will achieve good results also with images that don't match
this criterias - in a pinch, you can balance that by increasing the
number of tiles in your mosaic.
<br>If you also want to add the images in the subdirectories to the
database, select the "Include subdirectories" option. Confirm this
settings with the "Build the database" button to analyse the files in
the chosen folder and save the database file afterwards.</p>
<br><p>Now
stand by while the database is built. Depending on the amount of
pictures in the selected folder, this may take some time. First the
files in the chosen directory (and the subdirectories if chosen) are
indexed and added to the database - afterwards, the images are analyzed
to find out the average color. <br>If you cancel the process while the indexing of the files is
running, no database will be saved. If you cancel while analyzing the
files, the database will be saved, but only the already analyzed files
can be used when building a mosaic with this database. However, you can
analyze the missing files later in the "Edit Database"-dialog.</p>
<div align="left"><img src="pics/builddbprog.png" height="270" width="386"></div>

<br><p>If you see a dialog similar
to this one, then the database now is ready to use and was saved
successfully. You can create mosaics with it or edit it (add and remove
entries) - see below.</p>
<div align="left"><img src="pics/builddbcompl.png" height="270" width="386"></div>

<h2><a name="3.2">3.2 Edit an Image Database</a></h2>
<p>If you want to add or remove pictures to or from an existing
database or if there are problems (e.g. with files you deleted from the
storage device after adding them to the database), hit the "Edit
Database" button in the applications main window.
<br>Now select the database file you want to edit.</p>
<br><p>If the database contains files
that were not yet analyzed, that were edited in the meantime or that
could not be found, you will see this dialog. If you answer with yes,
all files will be analyzed and the ones that could not be found will be
marked (check if they are on a removable storage device that is not
plugged in!). You can also do this later from the "Edit
Database"-dialog. Note that if you deleted files that have an entry in
the database, you have to update it before you can build a mosaic with
it.</p>
		<div align="left"><img src="pics/dbincompl.png" height="137" width="506"></div>
<br>
<div align="left"><img src="pics/editdb.png" height="449" width="679"></div>
<p>This is the dialog that allows you to edit the database. 
<br>On the top, information about how many files are in the database
and how many of them are not analysed yet or could not be found is
shown.
<br>On the left side you see a list with all entries in the database.
If you select one that could be found, a preview and information about
the average color (if it was already analyzed) is shown in the middle.
With the "Remove this file from the database" button you can delete
this entry from the database (of course, it will not be deleted on the
storage device).
<br>On the top right corner, there is a list showing files that could
not be found or are no valid image files. With the "Remove files that
were not found" button you can delete these entries from the database.
Check if they are on a removable storage device that is not plugged in
first!
<br>Below, there is a list with entries that do exist but were not
analyzed yet. This means that they also won't be used when building a
mosaic with this database. Hit the "Update database" button to analyze
these files now.
<br>With the "Add a directory to the database" and "Add a file to the database" buttons you can add more entries to the database.
<br>The changes you made to the database will not be saved until you
hit the "Close" button and answer the question if you want to save the
changes with "Yes".
<br>If you have problems creating a mosaic with a certain database, it
is a good idea to load it here and hit the "Update database" button.
This will not only analyze the missing files, but also look for other
errors in the database and correct them (e.g. if you deleted a file
from your hard disk after adding it to the database).
