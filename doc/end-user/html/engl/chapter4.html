<h1>4. Create a Photographic Mosaic</h1>

<p>If you have already built an image database, you can create a photographic
mosaic with it now. If not, you first have to do so.</p>

<br><p>To start, hit the "New Mosaic" button in the applications
main window.</p>
<div align="left"><img src="pics/mainwin.png" height="581" width="686"></div>

<br>
      <p>In
the following dialog you have to set up the basic options for the new
mosaic. In the "Database file" field, you need to specify which
previously created picture database to use. For the "Original image"
field you have to select an image to use as base for the new mosaic.
Finally, in the "Mosaic file" field, you need to specify where to save
the newly created mosaic. After you have done so, hit the "Next" button.</p>
<div align="left"><img src="pics/createmosaic.png" height="258" width="660"></div>

<br><p>Here you have to choose the detailed options for the new
mosaic. <br>
First
comes the tile size. The mosaic will be built of many small tiles, each
one will have the size in pixels you adjust here. If you want to print
the mosaic, you should calculate a real size of at least 0.4 inch or 1
cm for the longest edge of the tile. Choose the tile size according to
your desired resolution. Values of 100-150 for the width are a good
starting point. <br>
The tile aspect ratio can be set below; choose the aspect
ratio, that equals the one of most of your entries in the pictures
database. If the images in the database have different aspect ratios,
1:1 is a good choice. </p>
<div align="left"><img src="pics/mosaicdetails.png" height="391" width="656"></div>
<p>The next option describes how to adjust tiles that don't fit
the aspect ratio chosen above; you can either cut the edges or scale
them. Note that if you choose to cut the edges and there is a big
difference between the selected tile aspect ratio above and the real
aspect ratio of the tile, it might happen that important details of the
image are cut off; otherwise, when choosing the scale option, the tiles
might look distorted in the mosaic. Therefore you will achieve the best
results if you use pictures where it isn't too bad if the edges are cut
off (e.g. landscapes) or if you take care, that all entries in the
selected database have a similar aspect ratio. I recommend to choose to
cut the edges.
<br>
Then select the total number of tiles in the mosaic; the higher
value you choose here, the better and more impressive the result but
also the amount of needed computing time and memory will be. Also note
that if you want to print the mosaic, to a poster e.g., you should
calculate a real size of at least 0.4 inch or 1 cm for the longest edge
of the tile. So if you build a mosaic of 4800 tiles and the original
image has an aspect ratio of 4:3 and select a tile aspect ratio of 1:1,
the mosaic will be built of 80x60 tiles. Then you would have to print a
poster with the size of at least 32x24 inch or 80x60 cm. I recommend to
set this to a value between 2000 and 10000, also depending on how
applicable the images in the selected database are.
<br>
The "Minimum distance between same tiles:" option lets you adjust,
how much distance must be at least between two occurances of a tile in
the completed mosaic. Note that choosing a too high value with a too
small database will lower the image quality or even make rendering the
mosaic impossible, as no more matching tile could be found.I recommend
to set this to a value between 4 and 10, depending on the original
image and the chosen database.
<br>
Now you can adjust how many times a certain tile may occur in a
mosaic maximal. Note that similar to the "minimal distance between same
tiles"-option, too low values will lower the image quality or even make
rendering the mosaic impossible, as no more mathing tile could be
found. I recommend to uncheck this and use the option above instead.
<br>
You can also set an alpha channel to blend the original image over
the resulting mosaic - this will influence the color of the tiles and
give better results if the images in your database are not the best
choice. Select "0" to disable blending the original image; "1" is the
most transparent value, "99" is the less transparent one. I recommend a
value of 30 or 33.
<br>
Finally, the size of the resulting mosaic is shown. This can give
you a hint about the memory and computing time that is required during
rendering the mosaic. A mosaic with 60 megapixels and alpha blending of
the original image will need about 300 megabyte of ram to render. The
rendering process will take 10-15 minutes on a fairly outdated AMD
Athlon XP mobile 2600+.
<br>
If you have set all the values to your pleasure, hit the "Render"
button.
</p>

<br><p>Now,
lie back and wait for the things to come. Depending on the selected
options and the speed of your computer, rendering the mosaic will take
some time.</p>

<br><p>If you get a dialog similar to this, then your mosaic was
rendered with success! <br>
If rendering the mosaic fails, see <a href="chapter5.html#5.1">"5.1
Rendering the Mosaic Fails"</a>.</p>

<br><p>Remember the filename of the created mosaic, hit the "Close"
button and do with it wathever you want to...</p>
