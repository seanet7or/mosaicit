<h1>2. Tutorial</h1>

<p>This short tutorial will show you the necessary steps to create a
photographic mosaic. For detailled information see the corresponding
help sites.</p>

<h2><a name="2.1">2.1 Brief Info About Creating an Image Database</a></h2>

<p>Before you can create a photographic mosaic, you have to set up an
image
database that contains all the pictures the mosaic will be made of.</p>

<p>Start the program, e.g. by clicking the start menu entry that was created during installation:<p>
<div align="left"><img src="pics/startmenu.png"></div>

<br><p>Then click the "Create Database" button in the main window:</p>
<div align="left"><img src="pics/mainwin.png" height="581" width="686"></div>

      <br><p>In the following dialog, you
have to select a filename for the new database file. Also select a
directory that contains the pictures the mosaic will be made of. Note
that the more pictures are in the directory, the better the result will
be. Adding more folders or files is possible in the <a href="chapter3.html#3.2">"Edit database"</a>
dialog later. If you also want to add the images in the subdirectories
to the database, select the "Include subdirectories" option. Confirm
this settings with the "Build the database" button to analyse the files
in the chosen folder and save the database file afterwards.</p>
      <div align="left"><img src="pics/builddb.png" height="176" width="612"></div>

      <br><p>Now
stand by while the database is built. Depending on the amount of
pictures in the selected folder, this may take some time. Canceling the
process will result in an incomplete database.</p>
<div align="left"><img src="pics/builddbprog.png" height="270" width="386"></div>

      <br><p>If you see a dialog similar to
this one, then the database now is ready to use and was saved
successfully. Hit the "Close" button and use it to create a
photographic mosaic!</p>

<p>For some more information about what to take care of, see chapter <a href="chapter3.html#3.1">"3.1 Creating an Image Database"</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="2.2">2.2 Brief Info About Creating a Photographic Mosaic</a></h2>

<p>Now we can use the image database to create a photographic mosaic
that uses the pictures from the database.</p>

<br><p>To do so, hit the "New Mosaic" button in the applications
main window.</p>
<div align="left"><img src="pics/mainwin.png" height="581" width="686"></div>

      <br><p>In
the following dialog you have to set up the basic options for the new
mosaic. In the "Database file" field, you need to specify which picture
database to use. Select the one you created before. For the "Original
image" field you have to select an image to use as base for the new
mosaic. Finally, in the "Mosaic file" field, you need to specify where
to save the newly created mosaic. After you have done so, hit the
"Next" button.</p>
<div align="left"><img src="pics/createmosaic.png" height="258" width="660"></div>

      <br><p>Here you have to choose the
detailed options for the new mosaic. I recommend to set the values
similar to the ones shown on the screenshot here.
      <br>
First comes the tile size. The mosaic will be built of many small
tiles, each one will have the size in pixels you adjust here. <br>
The tile aspect ratio can be set below; choose the aspect ratio, that
equals the one of most of your entries in the pictures database. If the
images in the database have different sizes, 1:1 is a good choice. <br>
The next option describes how to adjust tiles that don't fit
the aspect ratio chosen above; you can either cut the edges or scale
them. <br>
Then select the total number of tiles in the mosaic; the higher
value you choose here, the better and more impressive the result but
also the amount of needed computing time and memory will be. </p>
      <div align="left"><img src="pics/mosaicdetails.png" height="391" width="656"></div>
<p> The "Minimum distance between same tiles:" option lets you adjust,
how much distance must be at least between two occurances of a tile in
the completed mosaic. <br>
Now you can adjust how many times a certain tile may occur in a mosaic.
<br>
You can also set an alpha channel to blend the original image over
the resulting mosaic - this will influence the color of the tiles.
Select "0" to disable blending the original image; "1" is the most
transparent value, "99" is the less transparent one. I recommend a
value of 30 or 33.
<br>
Finally, the size of the resulting mosaic is shown. This can give
you a hint about the memory and computing time that is required during
rendering the mosaic. A mosaic with 60 megapixels and alpha blending of
the original image will need about 300 megabyte of ram to render. The
rendering process will take 10-15 minutes on a fairly outdated AMD
Athlon XP mobile 2600+.
<br>
If you have set all the values to your pleasure, hit the "Render"
button.
</p>
<br><p>Now,
lie back and wait for the things to come. Depending on the selected
options and the speed of your computer, rendering the mosaic will take
some time.</p>

<br>      <p>If you get a dialog similar to this, then your mosaic was
rendered with success!<br>
If rendering the mosaic fails, see <a href="chapter5.html#5.1">"5.1
Rendering the Mosaic Fails"</a>.</p>
<div align="left"><img src="pics/rendermoscompl.png" height="310" width="428"></div>

      <br><p>Remember the filename of the created mosaic, hit the "Close"
button and do with it wathever you want to... <br>
