<h1>1. Installation And System Requirements</h1>
<h2><a name="1.1">1.1 System Requirements</a></h2>
<p>MosaicIt! runs under Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Linux. Twenty
MB of hard disk disk space are required for the installation. Your
computer should have at least 256 MB of RAM. For your photo collection
and the created mosaics, more hard disk drive will be needed.<br>
Please note, that depending on the selected options you may need much
more than 256 MB of RAM to render a big mosaic in a reasonable time.
Rendering a photographic mosaic with 60 megapixels may need up to 300
MB of RAM and take up to 15 minutes on a fairly outdated AMD Athlon XP
mobile 2600+.</p>
